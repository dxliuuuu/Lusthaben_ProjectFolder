    <h2>PRESSURE</h2>
    <p>Pressure arrives first. Low, physical, undeniable. The bass folds around your ribs and squeezes as if the city is trying to enter you through vibration alone. Berlin teaches you that wanting is not abstract; it is mechanical. It grinds its teeth against your sternum. In the dark you feel the beat before you understand anything else. You want the pressure to deepen, to hollow you out, to push every thought out of your skull until all that remains is pulse. You desire obliteration through frequency, a clean erasure written in subwoofer language.</p>
  </div>
  
  <div id="text-2" style="display:none;">
    <h2>SKIN </h2>
    <p>Heat gathers next. Skin, sweat, breath. Every stranger becomes a furnace you orbit. You do not know their names, only the temperature they radiate. Berlin nights smell like salt and persistence, and somewhere between bodies you realize you are desiring something nameless: not a person, not touch, but the shared proof that you are alive and overheating together. Your body begs for more warmth, more humidity, more evidence of existence pressed close enough to blur. Heat becomes communion. You desire the moment before collapse, when everything is too much but still not enough.</p>
  </div>
  
  <div id="text-3" style="display:none;">
    <h2>LIGHT</h2>
    <p>Then light arrives. Desire flickers with the strobe. Split-second hunger, interrupted by darkness. The room becomes a slideshow of incomplete scenes: a hand reaching, a jawline caught mid-turn, sweat suspended like shattered glass. Everything is broken into fragments, and you ache for continuity. The strobe denies you, and that denial sharpens your wanting. You want what you cannot fully see. You want the ghost-version of every body, the versions that exist only for one flash at a time. The light fractures time, and desire collects in the cracks.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="text-4" style="display:none;">
    <h2>AIR</h2>
    <p>You inhale. The air is thick enough to chew. It tastes like smoke, adrenaline, half-finished confessions, the metallic tang of anticipation. You breathe it in anyway, greedy. In this city, inhalation becomes an act of desire. You want the air inside you, contaminated and communal. Every breath feels stolen from someone else’s lungs. Desire moves here as vapor, passed mouth to mouth, rising from skin. You want to swallow the whole room, let it dissolve on your tongue, take in every molecule the night has sweated out.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="text-5" style="display:none;">
    <h2>TIME</h2>
    <p>Time. Time slides off the clock and melts across the floor. Hours pool and mix like spilled drink. In Berlin, desire grows in the absence of morning. You want the night to keep mutating, to expand beyond the body, to become borderless. Your desire is temporal. You crave the prolonged moment where nothing matters except that it continues. You want the future to hesitate. You want the present to overstay. And when the sun finally intrudes through a crack in the concrete, it feels like a betrayal. The night collapses. You want it back immediately.</p>
